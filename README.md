# Supermarket_Data_Analysis_2022
Hi I am Payel , This is my   brief data analysis of supermarket 2022 dataset using excel

# INTRODUCTION
Sales marketing is the foundation of any successful commercial venture, flawlessly combining the complexities of salesmanship with the strategic perspective of marketing. At its foundation, it's about building genuine relationships with customers, understanding their needs and objectives, and directing them to a product or service that meets those goals. Supermarkets play an important role in meeting the different demands of consumers in today's quickly changing retail scene. Supermarkets now collect massive volumes of data via multiple channels, such as point-of-sale (POS) systems, customer loyalty programs, internet transactions, and supply chain operations, thanks to technological advancements. Analyzing this data can help supermarkets manage their operations, improve consumer experiences, and make better business decision .
## This project includes steps as follows :
- Data Understanding the Problems
